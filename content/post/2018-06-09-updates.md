Updated my [Listening](/page/listening/ "Listening") page and cleaned up my [Now](/page/now "Now") page.

Started with ABBA for this week, and the very first song The Winner Takes It All gets to you. ABBA could sing and make great music.

Made quite a few changes over the past few weeks, especially with learning Hugo and moving my blogs to it, as well as killing off a few blogs that I wasn't updating and letting go of the domains. Updated these details in the Now page.

This caps off to some extent a busy few weeks that I have had in the last couple of months.
