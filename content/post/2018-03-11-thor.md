  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3501632/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thor: Ragnarok</a> is a lot of fun, probably the most fun I&#8217;ve had in a while, and especially in a superhero movie.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Black Panther was good, but also accompanied by a lot of hype that did not do any service to the movie itself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On the other hand, I&#8217;d missed Thor: Ragnarok during its initial theatrical run and did not have much in the way of expectations going in to watch it on the home theater.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The visuals in Thor: Ragnarok are spectacular, the audio mix is good, just not something that will shake your home theater setup, but the movie itself is loads of fun.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Lots of good banter between the leads, comic relief interspersed with good action/CGI is a fun way to spend your Sunday afternoon, especially if accompanied by a large bowl of popcorn and soda.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Go ahead and watch Thor: Ragnarok already if you haven&#8217;t.
