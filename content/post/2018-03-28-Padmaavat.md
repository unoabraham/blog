<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5935704/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Padmaavat</a>, is a good watch, but a weak ending andÂ disservice to Alauddin Khalji ruin an otherwise good movie.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I will not go into too much detail about the movie and its review, lots of that going on the Internet anyways.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, well-done sir, we need more directors of your caliber.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The visuals are stunning, even epic though not always. Deepika Padukone delivers a nearly impeccable performance, and Shahid Kapoor holds his own, but Ranveer Singh has too much of a tumultuous performance, marked by the indifference of the script, his breakout performances in many scenes, and yet let down by a really weak ending that panders to the masses.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  What really ruined it for me was the extremely brown-nose depiction of Alauddin Khalji as an obsequious deviant, hardly befitting the real character of a sultan who conquered India. The director expects us to believe that a man with so many character flaws was also a military strategist and warrior who conquered most of India.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Not right Mr. Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you failed on this count.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Otherwise, Padmaavat is a good watch, streaming now on Amazon Prime Video.
