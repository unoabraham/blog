IndieWeb goals!

<p style="text-align: left;">
  After starting to IndieWebfy this blog, and after seeing a couple of blogs that have implemented it really well, I decided to set goals for this blog and myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The long-term goal is to have a personal hub of information, with everything posted on this domain (primarily), and not on web 2.0/3.0 or silos. Of course, the Internet might well go the route of blockchain with everything becoming decentralized by then, but I&#8217;m not holding out for that yet.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For starters (and just laying things out here).
</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Implement POSSE and backfeed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add online bookmarks functionality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add note taking/private note-taking and read it later functionality.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use Webmentions more effectively.
  </li>
</ul>
