<p style="text-align: left;">
  My weekly recommendation of Micro Monday for Micro.Blog goes to But She&#8217;s A Girl.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I don&#8217;t remember how I ran into her website, but pretty certain it comes down to either a recommendation over at Micro.Blog or someone sharing the website URL over at the IndieWeb Slack chatroom.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The content is insightful and also geeky, but extremely informative with step-by-step pictorials when needed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You can find her Micro.Blog atÂ <a href="https://micro.blog/bsag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@bsag</a> and her regular blog over at <a href="https://www.rousette.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">But She&#8217;s A Girl&#8230;</a>
