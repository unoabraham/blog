<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avengers: Infinity War</a>, I am getting geared up and ready for the big one.

I haven’t really dug deep into either MCU or DCEU (not really a comics guy) though I have watched most of the movies. However, like most non-regulars, my history of what really took place till now is a bit fuzzy and that will mean when I go to watch Avengers: Infinity War I’ll probably be like when did this happen, and what is the backstory to this.

So to save myself (and others who will ask me) all of those questions and have no answers forthcoming, I have decided to catch up on all things Avengers movie franchise before I go ahead and watch Avengers: Infinity War.

For starters, I will be watching The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, and Doctor Strange. Black Panther is still fresh in the memory, and I don’t think I will be needing anything else for the story arc. I will also be catching up on Guardians of the Galaxy and <span data-original-name="Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as I&#8217;ve never seen them before.</span>

So here’s to more entertainment on the home theater and becoming a Marvel fanboy in anticipation of Avengers: Infinity War.
