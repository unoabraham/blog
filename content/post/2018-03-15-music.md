A wonderful couple of hours spent listening to music and lost in the past…

Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/hisaac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@hisaac</a> I had a wonderful couple of hours listening to some wonderful music from the past, primarily Neil Young and Mark Morrison.

Now all of this makes me want to untangle the Amazon Echo devices and go back to the simpler listening devices that I used in the past. The music was rich, high quality, and also high on quality because of the artists/musicians themselves.

Ah the bliss.

Going to start on Ali Farka Touré next… some of the best guitar playing ever.
