<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5675620/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Punisher</a> Season 1 conclusion.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Took a couple of days to wrap up season 1 of The Punisher.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s a good series, high on the entertainment quotient, and suitably rewarding and satisfying in terms of the conclusion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Ben Barnes really comes into his own in the latter part of the series, though one does wish his story arc had more meat, especially the background/origins story. Despite these limitations, Ben Barnes does an excellent job portraying Billy Russo.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Punisher is a good watch, and certainly recommend it, especially if you are a fan of Jon Bernthal.
