Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2395427/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> and this was a lot more fun. Probably has to do with the fact that I absolutely love James Spader, and he is spot on perfect for the role of Ultron. His voice gives emotions to even a metallic robot making it act!

And then there were some moments like&#8230;

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  The fight between Hulk and Iron Man.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Jarvis AKA Vision picking up Thor&#8217;s hammer.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  The war of words between Iron Man and Ultron, truly hilarious.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  All the Avengers cornered in a building and taking on all of Ultron, truly spectacular.
</li>

and there is also the beginning and tying in of threads and loops like&#8230;

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  The reference to Wakanda.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Ulysses Klaue (played by Andy Serkis). This was something I&#8217;d failed to notice before.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  An introduction to the Infinity Stones (Infinity Gems).
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Thor: Ragnarok explaining what happened to the Hulk after Avengers: Age of Ultron.
</li>

A good time at the movies indeed.

The only thing wrong or could be improved upon, the audio just isn&#8217;t immersive enough.
