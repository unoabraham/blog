<p style="text-align: left;">
  I am not much of a coder or a design geek.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  However, the good thing is I did go with WordPress for my choice of CMS.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  WordPress gives you a lot of options and flexibility even in terms of design choice, and 100% free because there are a plethora of free themes available.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  However, as everyone knows &#8220;there is no such thing as a free lunch&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Anyways, from the very beginning, I was always a premium theme user. I started with the excellent Thesis theme from DIYthemes, before it got complicated and crazy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Then I stumbled onto Eric Hamm and his crazy design chops with Impact Page Builder, Catalyst Theme, and now morphed into Cobalt Apps. In a way, they introduced me to the wonderful StudioPress and the Genesis Framework. And then life came a full circle with the excellent Dynamik Website Builder for Genesis.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Thanks to Dynamik Website Builder for Genesis, even I can consider myself a designer, albeit a rather limited one.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Anyways it gives me the chops and the confidence to design, and more importantly, knowing it will not break things, or if they do, it&#8217;s an easy fix.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  As you will see, the design choice right now is minimalistic and limited to 3 colors (my favorite palette). I will make a copy of this and leave it be as &#8220;completed&#8221; as I can always return to it and use it right out of the box. But I am not done, I plan to tinker some more, but as a fork so I can always return to this point in design.
