<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104691/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of the Mohicans</a>, aÂ totally unrelated post from <a href="https://micro.blog/t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tantek</a> set me off to watch one of my all-time favorite movies.

Love everything about the movie, Daniel Day-Lewis is awesome playing an action hero, Madeleine Stowe the beautiful damsel in distress, and Wes Studi makes for a menacing villain, and along with some excellent cinematography, spectacular visuals and vistas, and a haunting background score and soundtrack &#8211; all make for a truly enjoyable fare.

Thanks, Tantek for the <a href="http://tantek.com/2018/100/t1/editor-css-2-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">totally unrelated post</a>.
