<p style="text-align: left;">
  Launch day.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Planned to launch my microblog today.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Woke up with a really bad headache, a little past 3 a.m.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Shouldn&#8217;t really be a problem though, having built and deployed multiple websites on WordPress in my previous businesses.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But the thing is I haven&#8217;t been working the past 3+ years, and have been out of sorts with all the latest blogging platforms like Ghost or even the latest in WordPress.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Thankfully, all of my equipment still works, kudos to my Blue Microphone and Dragon NaturallySpeaking, the words just roll off.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Okay, it&#8217;s time to get back to setting up this website. Only I gotta start with reading what&#8217;s necessary and important in terms of pages to have like disclaimer, terms of service, etc.
