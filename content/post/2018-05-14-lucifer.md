<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4052886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucifer</a>Â season 3 is a wrap. Most likely it is also a series finale as Fox has already announced its cancellation.

Gutted is not the word I would use, though I am certainly disappointed.

While I would not place Lucifer among the all-time greats like Breaking Bad and the Game of Thrones, it certainly had its moments in the entertainment department.

More importantly, I&#8217;m a fan of the lead actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0255124/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Ellis</a>, since his outing as Dr. Rush, which was canceled after the first season. Hopefully, Tom is going to be back soon in a new avatar.

Now that leaves me with only one actor that I am watching on the TV, the wonderful James Spader in The Blacklist.
