  Actually mine too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I recently came across a blog that gave me the good idea of rethinking my name for domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Thanks to Mayo Jordanov (<a href="https://micro.blog/oyam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@oyam</a> from Micro.Blog), now Maharba (Abraham in reverse) is a domain name possibility that I have never thought of.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But (and expectedly), Maharba.com is a premium domain and with an asking price ofÂ around $2500. It seems I&#8217;m not the only one with a grand idea of reverse names for domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Thanks, Mayo, for a cool trick and an even cooler email ID. I cannot wait to get mine.
</p>

  A very useful trick that will come in handy as everything Abraham (.com, .net, .org, .co, .in, .tv, etc.) have been taken or priced premium.
