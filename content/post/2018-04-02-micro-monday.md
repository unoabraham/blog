<p style="text-align: left;">
  My Micro Monday recommendation is for Eddie Hinkle.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You can find his Micro.Blog at <a href="https://micro.blog/eddiehinkle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@eddiehinkle</a> and his regular blog over at <a href="https://eddiehinkle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eddie Hinkle</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The recommendation is for a lot of random stuff on his website that is both insightful and thoughtful.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Also,Â IndieWeb related tips and tutorials on status updates, porting data from social media to his personal website, and customizing the website and homepage that has specifically given me a ton of ideas to work on.
