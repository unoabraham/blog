  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altered Carbon</a> is super awesome and a must watch.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Netflix is really taking things up a notch, especially with its original programming.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Binge watched the entire show, and to be honest loved pretty much everything about it. The visuals are stunning and best enjoyed on a large screen immersive OLED, or a PJ.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  While I will not go to the extent that it&#8217;s a modern-day classic or an all-time great, it is certainly very much on my must-watch list.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The visuals are out of this world, the action sequences are pretty rad, and performances overall are pretty good.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Special mention, the plot twists are just about perfect to keep you interested until the very end, but not overdone that you lose track and/or get tired of them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  All in all, a new serial that had me hooked and binge-watching till the very endâ€¦ not easily done anymore!
</p>

  Kudos to Netflix for pulling it off.
