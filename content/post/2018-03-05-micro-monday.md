<p style="text-align: left;">
  Micro Monday recommendation for Amit Gawande who microblogs at <a href="https://micro.blog/amit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@amit.</a> You can find his regular blog over at <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amit Gawande</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I actually ran into Amit&#8217;s blog even before he started microblogging. I was checking out other CMS to use in place of WordPress for a couple of new projects, and got introduced to his website via his review of Hugo.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Also, his minimalistic design caught my fancy, and the excellent website optics like the non-existent load times were extremely impressive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  His microblog recommendation is for content on a variety of topics, being helpful/social, and extremely conversant with the other microbloggers over at Micro.Blog on various topics.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Amit, it is a pleasure meeting you (even if it&#8217;s only virtual right now), but after reading your posts and also interacting with you via comments, you are one person I would like to meet and hang out with over a couple of cold ones.
