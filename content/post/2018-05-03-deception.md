<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6461812/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deception</a>, is a showÂ I started this on a lark, not knowing any of the lead stars or having any idea about the plot or the storyline.

Just one of those days when you are flipping through all of the available channels and streaming services, and happen to chance on something that catches your eye.

But 8 episodes in, and I&#8217;ve still not quit, and it continues to be entertaining. The final verdict is still out on this one, but I will continue watching Deception for now.

The only thing I don&#8217;t really like about the show is both Amaury Nolasco and Vinnie Jones is one totally wasted in insignificant/inconsequential roles.
