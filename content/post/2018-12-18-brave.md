The very first scene had me interested, my subwoofer was rumbling and my 4K TV was kicking into gear with excellent detail of the forest fire, as a bear on fire runs through the shot. My only thought was yay, time to relax and kick back the feet.

PS: I didn't know it was based on true events.

Despite a stellar cast of Josh Brolin, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Taylor Kitsch, Jeff Bridges, and Andie MacDowell, there really isn't much action and the story doesn't move forward too much either. It starts and ends mainly about the lives of a team of firefighters, about their training, firefighting, their families, and their troubles, all based on the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots.

The movie does pick up in the 3rd act, and delivers in the climax, with spectacular SFX in the firefighting scenes.

Of course, no movie can do justice to men who have lost their lives in the line of duty, but Only The Brave is a good way to honor their memory.
