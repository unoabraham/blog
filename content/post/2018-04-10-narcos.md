  Narcos season 2 is off to a blast. I’ve been putting off season 2 for a while now, and now into the 2nd episode my thoughts are why did I wait so long to watch it?

  Wagner Moura is sheer brilliance as Pablo Escobar, and ably supported by Boyd Holbrook and Pedro Pascal.

  Probably going to binge watch this one, it’s looking really good.
