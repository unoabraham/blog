<p style="text-align: left;">
  When in confusion.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It must have something to do with the primitive aspect of the human brain &#8211; the part that focuses on security and needs, but an interesting observation is when in confusion and overwhelm, the decision-making retreats to what&#8217;s safe and secure, and a known environment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Thanks to ICANN opening up all manner of domain extensions, the availability of choice can actually put one into a state of limbo and indecision.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I had so many choices available to me that I simply couldn&#8217;t decide on the domain name for a website.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The result? I went back to an old domain and used it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now, this may be temporary, as I did purchase 2 brand-new domains and have in mind several more, but personally, I&#8217;d rather have something in place and change that up down the line as opposed to procrastination + nothing.
