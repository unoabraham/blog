  It does look like a lot of folks are really leaving Facebook. And I don&#8217;t just mean the tweets with #DeleteFacebook.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Seeing a lot of folks on both the Local timeline as well as the Federated timeline with the same stated reason of having deleted Facebook and moved on.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I for one thought it was just another &#8220;breaking news&#8221; that people will forget and move on. More importantly, Facebook has no alternatives, and not for a while probably.
