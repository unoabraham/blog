<p style="text-align: left;">
  An unusual work day.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Spent the entire day reading up on IndieWeb, and mostly watching the videos.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  For the most part nothing new for folks who have been building websites and self-hosting with the likes of WordPress. The addition of Webmention however introduces what I would term “social blogging”.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Interesting times ahead, should things take off in a big way.
