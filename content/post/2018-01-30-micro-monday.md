  For Micro Monday (yes that&#8217;s a thing), I would like to recommend someone I came across on Micro.Blog, and then eventually wound up on their blog, <a href="https://www.inthemargins.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flashing Palely in the Margins</a>.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A lot to discover and learn from Sameer Vasta (<a href="https://micro.blog/vasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@vasta</a>), whether it&#8217;s the blogging platform he&#8217;s using, <a href="https://blot.im/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blot</a>, the photographs that he manages to capture, or just the interesting reading and random fun facts one gets to discover.
