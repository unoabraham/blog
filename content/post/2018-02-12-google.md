<p style="text-align: left;">
  A very interesting talk, surprisingly a spiritual one at one of the world&#8217;s leading scientific and technology firms.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Heard this Richard Rohr Talk at Google, mostly on his book &#8220;The Divine Dance: The Trinity and Your Transformation&#8221;.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I haven&#8217;t read the book myself, but from cursory online reviews, I understand it&#8217;s about knowing God, as opposed to knowing about Him.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Richard raises a lot of questions, many of which will get you thinking.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I do recommend that you make the time to listen to this talk.
