Don’t expect too much cause it’s not much. But Skyscraper certainly has it’s moments and will keep you on the edge of your seat a fair bit. I do however wish they put Dwayne Johnson in a no holds barred shoot ‘em up gunfight to the finish movie… sadly Skyscraper is not that kind of fun.

But on the whole it’s good fun, especially the big screen variant, and it was good to see Neve Campbell after a really long time.

An entertaining time at the movies with the kids and it won’t be taxing your brain cells one bit.

Rock on!!!
