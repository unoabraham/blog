<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Just one of those days when you have to call it quits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Spent a good deal of time today trying to hack WordPress for some added customization.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And then coming to the realization I&#8217;m no coder and calling it quits.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Then again, it will come to me in a flash and everything will seem so easy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  But I&#8217;m done for now.
