  Nothing is fair.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I keep coming across people who keep complaining that life isn&#8217;t fair.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Life sucks.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Come to think of it, nothing is fair. Life isn&#8217;t fair, people aren&#8217;t fair, and governments very certainly aren&#8217;t fair.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Maybe the sooner you realize this, the better off you will be.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Life wasn&#8217;t created to be fair, it was created to be enjoyed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Live a little, love a little, in short, get a life.
