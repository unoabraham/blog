Started with Def Leppard as the musical artist for this week (check my <a href="https://abraham.one/page/listening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Listening</a> page), June 23, 2018 to June 29, 2018 and the very first track was the timeless classic Pour Some Sugar on Me. What followed (and expectedly) was a couple of hours of foot tapping rock music and me going down memory lane into the 80s, the time I was introduced to Def Leppard.

I have always been a huge Def Leppard fan, and have collected most of their albums, though to be honest I have not kept up with them this past decade, and I’m totally in the dark about their latest album releases.

Now should be as good a time as any to catch up on their latest and see how it measures up to their greatest. Hysteria, needless to say, is one of my all-time favorite albums.

Folks who haven’t heard/discovered Def Leppard, their Hysteria album is an excellent start.

Enjoy Pour Some Sugar on Me as I sign off.</p>
