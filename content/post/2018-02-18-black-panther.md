<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1825683/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Panther</a> is good, just forget the hype. Black Panther is a recommended watch and will make for a great time at the movies.

Coming to the story, it pretty much fits The Hero&#8217;s Journey to a T.

Chadwick Boseman was good, as was the rest of the cast. Martin Freeman continues to be a lot of fun, however, Hollywood&#8217;s casting of Angela Bassett and Forest Whitaker could have been made better with actors from Africa.

For a movie about Africa, they should have had more actors from Africa instead of America. Michael B. Jordan continues to impress, and brings his own brand of energy to the role.


In summary, a good movie and highly entertaining.
