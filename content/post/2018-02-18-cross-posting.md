  You need to stop cross-posting NOW.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Think about it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The longer you continue to use social media, the longer you keep them alive.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You give them a voice.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You even give them the platform (that&#8217;s rightfully yours).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The only way is to rip off the Band-Aid and get it done and over with.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Cross-posting should be done and dead. Like yesterday.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Otherwise, you are just fooling yourself. Even when you use <strong>heavy</strong> words like IndieWeb, self-hosted, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  PS: But then what do I know? I still have my Twitter account and might even end up using it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Guess this is what they mean by altered states of consciousness.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Facebook though is still deactivated.
