I saw an interesting video by Dezeen on the use of drones and our future. Lots of interesting scenarios from simple delivery tools and daily transportation to defense and even terrorism.

Obviously, there is always a portend of a struggle and something bad that can happen in the future, today’s journalism wouldn’t be the same without that thrown in.

But nonetheless, an interesting video to watch at least to realize that drones are here and here to stay. They are going to be a part of our daily life whether we like it or not.</p>
