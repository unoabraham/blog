Had a fab day with the Avengers ensemble while watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4154756/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avengers: Infinity War</a>.

Couldn’t make it the first week as I was tied up with other “stuff”, but this deservedly gets a must watch vote from me.

For me personally, the movie more than lives up to its hype unlike Black Panther.

While the movie itself was super awesome, it only served the purpose of an entrée with everyone looking forward to Avengers 4, 5, and 6 to complete the main course and the dessert.

This was definitely an out and out Thanos movie, and while not an origins story, it still served as an introduction to the Thanos mythos with the Avengers ensemble serving as props.

There really isn’t anything to not like about the movie, but there isn’t enough of the actual Avengers on-screen time, unlike the previous 2 iterations.

Avengers: Infinity War is a total blast, go ahead and watch it with the entire family.
