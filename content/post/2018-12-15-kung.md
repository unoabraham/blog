This is truly funny. Yes it is over the top and ridiculously loud, but it is seriously good too.

Even more incredible, it is only 30 mins long.

There really isn't much of a story to speak of. Our hero David Sandberg is both a cop and also the greatest martial artist of all time aka Kung Fury. He must go back in time to kill the greatest evil of all time Adolf Hitler aka Kung FÃ¼hrer.

What follows is time travel along with Thor, a laser dinosaur, and Triceracop all taking on Hitler and his armies.

Loads of fun be warned.
