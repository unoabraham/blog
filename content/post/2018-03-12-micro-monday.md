<p style="text-align: left;">
  Micro Monday recommendation for Manton Reece for the wonderful community he has created/made possible at Micro.Blog
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Also, kudos for the stellar support and help he offers in the running of Micro.Blog. Yes, it&#8217;s his baby, but for the most part (and time) Manton goes out of his way to help people and fix things.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Amazingly, he is pretty much 24 x 7 active (at least IMHO) either at Micro.Blog or the Slack Group for Micro.Blog Indie Microblogging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And to top it all he&#8217;s also a developer, podcaster, blogger, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee connoisseur</a> who has given me the idea to do a roundup of all the coffee joints in town.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  You can find his Micro.Blog at <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and his regular blog at <a href="http://www.manton.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manton</a>.
