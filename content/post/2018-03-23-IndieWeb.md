The irony of IndieWeb.

Last year I went about cleaning up/nuking most of my social profiles including very old ones like Foursquare. I even junked my Yahoo account.

And today, I’m back to resurrecting my Facebook account, setting up Twitter, and even creating accounts/profiles on Foursquare and Yahoo (for Flickr).

Still, there is no guarantee the social profiles will stay. I’m owning my content and posting everything on my own domains including a photoblog. The social profiles are only for POSSE and can still be nuked.
