I wanted to watch WWDC, the 2018 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, but when searching for live streaming options it seems that it only plays nice with Apple's Safari and Microsoft Edge.

Not sure what's with it, the Internet is supposed to be open for all, and Chrome is the browser of choice for most folks.

Well that put a damper on my desire to watch the WWDC live stream, so it was time spent with The Who instead.
