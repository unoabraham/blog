10 days with Pink Floyd. Yes,Â 10 days of music from Pink Floyd, and only Pink Floyd.

This was something I used to do a lot in the past, but haven&#8217;t recently, at least not since the artificial intelligence ladies came home i.e. Amazon&#8217;s Alexa, Apple&#8217;s Siri, and of course, Google&#8217;s OK Google.

Since the tall cylindrical ladies came home, artificial intelligence has been deciding my playlist and even the artists I listen to.

I decided to change that up by going back to my old format of listening to music &#8211; pick an artist, a genre, or a decade, and listen to music from that artist/genre/decade for a month or more. Typically, I would do the chronological discography and then repeat ad infinitum till the month was over.

This is an excellent way to discover new music/artists or get extremely familiar with a genre or an artist and their music. I went from a Shakira newbie to a Shakira pro by listening to all of her albums (even the Spanish ones, never mind I don&#8217;t speak a word of Spanish) over a three-month extended listening session.

Coming to Pink Floyd, I&#8217;ve been listening to them from the 80s, so this was less of a discovery phase, and more of a rediscovery phase. There&#8217;s way too much musical goodness in Pink Floyd for me to cover in a post so I am not going to be attempting that. Instead, I&#8217;ll simply share some of their best songs in random order.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  One of the best intros ever, and the guitar solo will transport you. This is prime Pink Floyd at their very best, and one of the greatest ballads ever.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Probably the national anthem for most Pink Floyd aficionados.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Hits you from the very first ka-ching. A perfect song for the social wannabe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A perfect song for when you want to wind down, you can even call it a lullaby. The hypnotic rhythm will transport you to a place that is all things Pink Floyd.
