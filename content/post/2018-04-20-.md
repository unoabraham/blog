Updated my <a href="https://abraham.red/now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Now</a>Â page.

Now page contents to be updated.

Started a linkblog, this completes another of my IndieWeb goals.

I haven&#8217;t been heavy user of RSS, and don&#8217;t link to my feeds on any of my blogs or websites, but decided it was high time I did. I added RSS feeds to the navigation menus of all of my blogs and websites.
