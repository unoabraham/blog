  Looking back, and considering the value proposition a.k.a. the value standard one sets for themselves is how they will be perceived later on.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In other words, work like a dog, and don&#8217;t be surprised when you are treated like a dog.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The takeaway here is you set your own standard. Not so much in words, or even in &#8220;branding&#8221;. You set your standard by your actions (for the most part).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  If you want to be valued down the line, then start paying attention to your actions in the now.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Another (and much better) way to increase your value proposition is to renew your mind with God&#8217;s Word and start seeing yourself as He sees you.
