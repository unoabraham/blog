<p style="text-align: left;">
  Valentine&#8217;s Day, time to count your blessings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Not much on romance (at least I&#8217;m not the guy who gives chocolates and roses), but I do love my wife tons.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I typically don&#8217;t celebrate my birthday or any other kind of festivities, but Valentine&#8217;s Day has become a tradition where we go out, grab lunch, maybe a movie, and mostly spend time together.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Looking back I realize I don&#8217;t appreciate how fortunate I am in my better half. Truly, she is the better part of me.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Valentine&#8217;s Day is a day as good as any to be thankful for all the love and the loving people in your life.
