Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0848228/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Avengers</a> as I get ready for the Avengers: Infinity War release date.

One thing I observed was that the scale and destruction do seem a bit dated especially in comparison to recent monster and disaster movies.

Also, the movie itself wasn&#8217;t as much fun as it was the first time around.

However, you do pick up on small things that begin to form a thread with the rest of the Avengers movies as well as the MCU franchise.

One, in particular, was the introduction of Thanos during the post-credits scene. Cool enough to make it worth the time spent in watching the movie again.
