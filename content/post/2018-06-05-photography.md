An excellent and highly recommended watch, this is more of a primer towards HDR in photography, and how it can be used as an aid to improve the quality of the photographs.

It is not a full-blown tutorial, like I said more of a primer that will introduce you to HDR photography.

Also, not really needed for 99% of us. Getting the latest Google Pixel 2 will absolutely kill it for 99% of our needs and for the 99% of us including all amateur photographers and shutterbugs.

However, the video to watch if you want an introduction to HDR photography and want to dip your toes into it.<p>
