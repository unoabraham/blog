  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3890160/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baby Driver</a>Â is a heist gone wrong/Gone in 60 Seconds action caper that stands on its own feet thanks largely to an ensemble cast that performs way above the bar for this genre.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The movie does have its moments, especially the car/foot chase sequences, but also struggles to maintain the tempo and fails especially in the third act.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What keeps the movie going is the ensemble cast of Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Jon Bernthal, and in particular Jon Hamm, while the leads Ansel Elgort and Lily James lend able support.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Baby Driver is an enjoyable joyride and better than your average action superhero fare. I only wish the ending was superlative within an elaborate car chase that gave us even more of an adrenaline rush.
