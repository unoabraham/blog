  Cancel really means cancel.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I was playing with an old G Suite account and trying to add a new domain to it. Searching on Google led me to believe that it is easily done by starting a trial, changing the primary domain, and then canceling the trial.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Said instructions did not work, all I did was start the trial on a legacy G Suite account that was set up to be free for life.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Since I couldn&#8217;t get what I wanted, which was to change the primary domain, and I did not want to pay for something that was already mine (and free for life), I went ahead and canceled the trial.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That went ahead and canceled the trial and also my legacy G Suite account. Yeah, no more free G Suite account for that domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Cancer really means cancelâ€¦ whoever thought of that?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Ah, small mercies I guess. That was not a domain I was using anyway and did not have any plans to use. Also, more importantly, I&#8217;m still mighty glad I have the legacy G Suite setup for several of the domains I am using and free for life.

  Anyways, the takeaway here is don&#8217;t go around playing with stuff you have no idea about, especially when it comes to the mighty G.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And more importantly, if you click on cancel when it comes to anything Google, it really does just that.
