  A decade (or 2 ago) blogs were fun. They were informative, entertaining, and even added value. I used to follow a bunch of them, on diverse topics from self-improvement to the latest in technology. Reading them was more than a ritual, it was an exercise in informing myself and even improving myself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Sadly, all of that seems to be lost to the world, at least to the modern generation growing up on social media.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  What killed blogs? Marketers for one. Social media, in particular, Facebook and Twitter.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So where does one go for information? YouTube is still a good choice and thankfully.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Other than that, Twitter seems to be the go-to place. Everybody has everything to say in under 140 or 280 characters, but nothing to add of value.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Anyways, this has started me on a quest to discover blogs that are funny/entertaining, informative, and have something useful to share.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Hopefully, I can find them and then share them on here.

  Till then, here are the Black Eyed Peas going Where Is the Love?
