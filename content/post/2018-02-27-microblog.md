  Yes, I&#8217;m still looking for a home for my microblog.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  From what I see, most folks have been hosting their microblogs on the micro.blog service with or without the use of a custom domain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Many others have been using a &#8220;micro&#8221; subdomain on their main website or blog.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Because of my penchant for keeping things clean and separate, I was always sold on the idea of a separate domain name.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  With that in mind, I registered <a href="https://abraham.uno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnoAbraham.com</a>, but haven&#8217;t fully warmed myself to that being the permanent home of my microblog. Unoabraham is the nick/username I use only because I cannot get Abraham most of the time, my obvious choice being Abraham.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m still undecided, andÂ I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s going to be back to the drawing board on this one until I get hit by a bolt of illumination that settles it for me.
