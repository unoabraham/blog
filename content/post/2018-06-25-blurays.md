Though a bit dated (from April 2017) this is an excellent primer and introduction to Blu-rays with the best quality in terms of picture and audio, what the home theater geeks would term reference quality.

It does not go into the quality of the movies themselves, and as such is not reviewing the movies, but the reviews and the selection are entirely limited to the video and audio quality of the Blu-ray discs, both in Full HD and Ultra HD. They also cover Blu-ray discs with 3D, so there's a little bit of everything for everyone.</p>

This will serve as a ready reckoner for folks dipping their toes into a home theater setup at home, and get them started on the very best Blu-ray discs in Full HD and Ultra HD that will let them show off their TVs, projectors, amplifiers, and speakers.

Too bad, Scott Wilkinsonâ€™s Home Theater Geeks was pulled off the air a while back. This was one show I watched regularly, extremely informative for the home theater enthusiast.
