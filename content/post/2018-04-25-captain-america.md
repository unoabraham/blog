Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Captain America: Civil War</a>. For starters, this was still fresh in my memory as I&#8217;d not watched it on the big screen when it released, but on Blu-ray fairly recently.

But I watched it anyways for continuity and to pick up on any cues for future movies in the MCU.

What I really loved were the spectacular action sequences. The tunnel fight between Captain America, Black Panther, and the Winter Soldier set the bar high, and the action continues nonstop for the rest of the movie.

What did I not like? It felt too much like an Avengers movie and less like a Captain America movie. A bit of a departure from the previous Captain America movies.
