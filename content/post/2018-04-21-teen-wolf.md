<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Teen Wolf, the series is a wrap.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It was good, solid, just not extravagant or going off base. More importantly, while it was the ending of the series, it was also in a way the beginning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The final 2 episodes were made even more memorable with the return of major cast members like Tyler Hoechlin, Colton Haynes, Gideon Emery, Michael Hogan, and Jill Wagner. Of course, there were also notable absentees like Crystal Reed and Arden Cho.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So that completes another TV series in its entirety. I will certainly be missing Scott McCall and his friends, though the ever-popular Dylan O&#8217;Brien will be soon returning with Maze Runner: The Death Cure.
