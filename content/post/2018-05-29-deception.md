<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6461812/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deception</a> wrapped up with a two-hour season 1 finale, that also served as a series finale as the cancellation has been announced.

Too bad, it was entertaining and especially kept the mystery alive throughout the series and opened the door to more intriguing possibilities with the two-hour season/series ending finale.

I for one would have loved for Deception to continue, and to discover what Stephanie Corneliussen was really up to.

I will miss it for sure, mostly good performances by Jack Cutmore-Scott, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Lenora Crichlow though as Iâ€™ve stated previously both Amaury Nolasco and Vinnie Jones were totally wasted.

Still a good show that had a lot to offer, and yet another victim of an untimely and hasty cancellation.
