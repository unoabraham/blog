  Stuck on you goes the song by Lionel Richie, and it is looping in my head simply because I&#8217;m stuck on what to write today.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  However, I did run into this quote on another microblog,
</p>

> &#8220;Start writing, no matter what. The water does not flow until the faucet is turned on.&#8221;
  
> Louis L&#8217;Amour

<p style="text-align: left;">
  which not only put things into perspective succinctly, but reminded me of the primary reason I started this blog a.k.a. microblog, just to get back into the habit of writing something, and getting back into the flow.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just want to mention though that my not having anything to write about does not mean nothing happened, on the contrary a lot happens even on my most normal/average days. However, I&#8217;ve never been social to the extent I share everything from a photograph of my morning cup of coffee to my shot of whiskey late into the night. I missed the mark of becoming a millennial… so I&#8217;m not into the habit of sharing everything.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  However, I have come to accept microblogging is a good thing, even if at the very least it gets me talking and sharing something. It&#8217;s more like I write for myself, even if nobody else is reading.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So that&#8217;s my take away for today, start writing, no matter what as eloquently put by Louis L&#8217;Amour.

  Get gabbing folks!
