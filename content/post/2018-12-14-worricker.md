Caught up on an old school spy trilogy starring the wonderful Bill Nighy and ably supported by an excellent ensemble cast of powerhouse performers like Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Helena Bonham Carter, Winona Ryder, Ewen Bremner, Christopher Walken, and Felicity Jones to name a few.

Now that should be enough to get anyone excited about this TV Movie trilogy... yes that's made for TV movies.

But at the outset let me warn you it's no James Bond. There is not much action to speak of, it's mostly a thriller trilogy that's performance based and requiring of acting chops to keep you and everyone else interested.

And that it accomplishes, it is wonderfully acted, especially the face off between Bill Nighy and Ralph Fiennes, keeps you interested and guessing for the most part, and will not leave your brain dazed and/or confused.

I will not lead you into spoiler territory, but take it fromme, it is well worth investing the time in and it comes highly recommended this week of Aquaman.

The trilogy order to be watched in...

* Page Eight (2011).
* Turks & Caicos (2014)
* Salting the Battlefield (2014)
