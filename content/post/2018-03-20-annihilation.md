  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annihilation</a>, crazy is as crazy does.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  At the very outset, Annihilation does not know what to do with itself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s all over the place, but that&#8217;s not the beginning/end of it. It really doesn&#8217;t have a reason to exist!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The movie seems to be have been made with the express purpose to shock and awe the audience.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But the audience needs a reason (or more) to be shocked and in awe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That&#8217;s something that seems to have completely escaped the makers of Annihilation.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Even Natalie Portman isn&#8217;t reason enough to sit through this unmitigated mess.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  PS: I haven&#8217;t read the book/s. But I don&#8217;t think anyone would want to watch/read something that doesn&#8217;t explain the reason why.
