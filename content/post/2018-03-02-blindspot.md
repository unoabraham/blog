<p style="text-align: left;">
  Catching up on Season 3 of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4474344/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blindspot</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m still not sure why I watch it? Nothing much is happening here.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Maybe it&#8217;s the eye candy of Jaimie Alexander.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Or maybe I have a thing for Sullivan Stapleton ever since I saw Strike Back.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492179/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strike Back</a> is an amazing show, one of my favorites. It comes highly recommended, lots of fast action, gunfights, on the backdrop of a spy drama.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Warning: Season 1 is so-so, season 2 is where things really take off.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Go ahead and watch it now. You can thank me later.
