<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Chuck Season 2 done.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Had a lot of fun with this one, in fact, enjoyed it more than Season 1.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  While I&#8217;m excited for Season 3, going to take a break and catch up on some other shows that are pending.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Scandal Season 6 is first on the agenda.
