  TV shows I need to wrap up.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In line with yesterday&#8217;s post about starting season 2 of Designated Survivor, here are a few more that I need to wrap up, probably the final seasons for a few.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Off the top of my headâ€¦
</p>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Teen Wolf, need to complete the final season.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scandal, need to catch up on the penultimate season and get ready for the final season.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Shannara Chronicles, might not catch up on season 2 as the show stands canceled, and it was average at best.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mad Men. Yet to start this, I know I know, but life got in the way and there was always going to be time later on.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Walking Dead. Need to watch season 7 and then catch up on season 8 too. Somehow lost interest after watching the first episode of season 7, probably the cliffhanger of season 6 was to blame.
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Of course, there are a few more, I just can&#8217;t remember them right now.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  PS: Interesting fact &#8211; a year ago when I checked I was watching as many as 80+ TV shows, mostly binge-watching and catching up on all the shows I had missed out on.
