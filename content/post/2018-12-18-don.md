I grew up on the song Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman? by Bryan Adams.

{{< youtube hq2KgzKETBw >}}

But never watched the movie. Until I was reminded of it and decided it was time to catch up.

My first thoughts and impressions.

I fail to see the point of this movie.

No really.

Johnny Depp thinks he is Don Juan and gets sent to the hospital where he impacts his shrink, Marlon Brando, and the hospital staff bringing out the lover in each of them. For Marlon Brando this ignites the spark in his marriage with Faye Dunaway even as he is days away from retirement and getting ready for life after it.

And yes I still fail to see the point of it all.

Going to get me some Japanese Kaiju monsters.
