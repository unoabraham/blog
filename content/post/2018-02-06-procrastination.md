  As I <a href="https://abraham.uno/musings/next-gets-decide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked back</a> on my collection of unused domains and business ideas I began to think why didn&#8217;t all of them make it past the idea stage?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The primary reason I could come up with was that people are lazy. We tend to procrastinate, a lot.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This is especially true for solopreneurs (solo entrepreneurs), people who work from home, stay-at-home mommies and daddies who have to manage both family and business from home, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Lazy is just one word, I don&#8217;t want you to get hung up on it. People aren&#8217;t inherently lazy, but entrepreneurs tend to procrastinate a lot and not always because of laziness.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In my own case, I used to procrastinate a lot, but not because I was lazy. If anything I used to work over 15 hours every day on my multiple businesses. However, I was a perfectionist (still am), and that meant many projects did not get completed only because it wasn&#8217;t aÂ Michelangelo.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I have since learned from my mistakes or rather learned to be productive despite all of my shortcomings.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Everybody has their own methodology for beating procrastination and staying productive. Mine is taking bite-sized actions consistently that add up to massive action over a period.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This microblog is a good example, bite-sized chunks of small action daily, but with the potential to develop into something more over time. And it&#8217;s not just about this blog either. Writing daily puts me in the habit of writing, get my creative juices flowing, sets my daily standard to taking action (even if only small incremental daily steps), and sets me up for the big push.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Everyone has their own formula for beating procrastination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Here is the Steven Pressfield way, distilled into 2 videos that will get anyone started on the path to action by pointing them in the right direction.
