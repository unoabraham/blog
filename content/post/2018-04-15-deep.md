<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Deep calleth unto deep &#8211; Psalm 42:7
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Going deeper is the only way to get more understanding.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Most folks struggling are also looking for answers but in the wrong place. You won’t find them in this plane of existence.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You will discover the answers only in a deeper realm, something I have been learning myself over the past year.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Emphasis mine, “listen to your gut” is a thing, and something worth digging deep into.
