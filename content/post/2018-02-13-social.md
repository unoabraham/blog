<p style="text-align: left;">
  Everybody needs a social media sabbatical.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I realized something very deep and profound today.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Social media will eat you for lunch and pop the bag.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Think about that for a moment… let it sink in.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I was on Twitter, read a couple of tweets, and immediately I was incensed and angry at stupid people saying and doing stupid things.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now I have always followed some good advice, namely…
</p>

> Never argue with an idiot, they will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Bible puts it better…
</p>

> Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. &#8211; Proverbs 26:4

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Think of all the wonderful things you could be doing and you are missing out on because you would rather spend your time on social media.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  There are a million other productive ways to be spending your time. Skills that will enhance the quality of your life, add profitability to your bottom line, improve your health, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  At the very least, staying off of Twitter will keep your blood pressure levels in check.
