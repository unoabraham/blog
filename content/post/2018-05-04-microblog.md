<p style="text-align: left;">
  The plan was to binge-watch Season 7 of Scandal and I did that for a couple of episodes until something more important came up.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  More important? Yup, like cleaning up my microblog.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Spent a couple of hours removing all the titles, setting up redirection to the new URLs, and porting the long form content to a new blog.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This now is strictly a microblog without any titles.
