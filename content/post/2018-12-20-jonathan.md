I liked it. Going in I found a lot of negative reviews that nearly made me not want to watch it, but I'm glad I did decide to go ahead and watch it.

Ansel Elgort is doing something different (or at least trying to be different) in his roles, The Fault in Our Stars and Baby are good examples, and Jonathan is a good addition to that list.

In Jonathan he suffers from multiple personalities, in other words multiple individual people all sharing the same body. Each has his own life, Jonathan from 7 am to 7 pm, and with no recollection of what happens between 7 pm to 7 am, which belongs to John. He keeps in touch with his "brother" by leaving video recordings of his life and also receives updates from his brother the same way.

Trouble arises when both start seeing the same girl, Suki Waterhouse. From that point on it becomes obvious that the two cannot share the same body. One brother attempts suicide and begins to sink into depression, until both realise that it is time to let go of the other.

The ending isn't really explained, and left to your imagination and interpretation, but I guess that's the only way the movie could end, after the fine ride it was up until that point.

Not for everyone, but give it a try. If it draws you in, then it is for you.
