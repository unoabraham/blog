<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Scandal season 6 is a wrap.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Of course, lots of the good stuff like who did what, subplots, and plot twists that will leave you guessing.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And makes you wonder if the deep state is a real thing?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Performances continue to be great, Scandal has always had its fair share of good performers starting with Papa Pope and Mama Pope.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In season 6, Olivia comes a full circle, and reason enough for watching the show.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Sets things up nicely for the series finale in season 7.
