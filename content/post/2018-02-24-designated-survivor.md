  Caught up with all the episodes of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5296406/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designated Survivor</a>Â season 2, all up-to-date.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The show itself seems to hold my interest, I&#8217;m surprised too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Over the past few months, I kind of got bored of binge-watching Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, etc. and unfollowed a bunch of TV shows.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It must be Kiefer Sutherland, cannot think of any other reason why.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now waiting for the show to return, especially after the way they left things over the mid-season finale.
