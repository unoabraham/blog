  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357547/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jessica Jones</a> is returning.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The trailer for season 2 of Jessica Jones is out and looks good too.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yes, I am having superhero fatigue, especially on the big screen, but that still did not stop me from watching the latest Black Panther and also enjoying it immensely.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Along with Daredevil, Jessica Jones has been one of the better superheroes on the television.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That reminds I have to still catch up on The Punisher, hopefully, a long binge-watching weekend is coming up soon.

  Oh, catch the Jessica Jones season 2 trailer below.
