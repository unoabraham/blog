Everybody has been going ga-ga over Facebook deprecating its API for publishing. This has been a result of the fallout of the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and was to be expected.

<a href="https://werd.io/2018/im-done-with-syndication-lets-help-people-be-themselves-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m done with syndication. Let’s help people be themselves on the web.</a>

However, nobody seems to be asking the question…

Shouldn&#8217;t Facebook be limiting apps access to user&#8217;s personal data? But instead, they are actually limiting apps from publishing to Facebook.

Imagine there is a robbery at your local bank and instead of beefing up security to prevent robbers from having easy access to your hard earned money, the bank is setting up security measures that make it difficult for you to deposit money into your bank account and/or fixed deposits.

Sounds ridiculous, doesn&#8217;t it? But that is exactly what Facebook is doing.
