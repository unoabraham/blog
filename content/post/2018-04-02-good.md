<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I recently had a talk with a friend who told me who else is there?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  That got me thinkingâ€¦
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Do we start eating stinking and rotten food because there is no good food?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Do we marry and settle down with an alcoholic and wifebeater because there are no more good men?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Do we marry a nag, a shrew, and a husband-beater because there are no more good women?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Do we start voting for a racist Islamophobic hatemonger because there are no more good politicians?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Is that what we have become as a society?
