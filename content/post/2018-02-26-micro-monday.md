<p style="text-align: left;">
  My recommendation for Micro Monday this time around is Scott McNulty aka @blankbaby on the Internet. His microblog and profile can be found atÂ <a href="https://micro.blog/blankbaby" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@blankbaby.</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Let me start with the obvious for my recommendation, Scott is funny. Just reading his one-liner intros for his various <a href="http://blankbaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web properties</a> will have you cracking up or at the very least chuckling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Here is a guy who can laugh at himself.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And we all need that every day, something that will make you smile and laugh (even if it&#8217;s only internal).

  PS: Scott if you are reading this, then please fix the broken links and please do blog more&#8230; even if it&#8217;s only status updates.
