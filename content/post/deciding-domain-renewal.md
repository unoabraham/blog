  What next? Who gets to decide?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s that time of the year again when I have to renew a bunch of domains.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Looking over them I realize I need to make some hard decisions because not all of them &#8220;businesses&#8221; are going to get done. There are some topics and niches in there that I still feel strongly about, but I also need to unostentatiously come to terms with the fact that I am never going to get around to actually doing anything about them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The hiatus over the last 3 years has taught me a lot of things, most important of them all being less is more and doing things right the first time. Time is precious, there really is no unending supply of it, and one cannot always go back or take more time in fixing things. The better use of your time and resources is to take a step back, and find the one thing you want to focus all of your energies on, and give it your best.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Needless to say, this raises the question how to decide and/or who gets to decide?
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  More on that later (no I&#8217;m not being a tease), but I just want to throw this out here so you will think before you act. Hopefully, this will help you cut down on a lot of what would otherwise be wasted effort.
