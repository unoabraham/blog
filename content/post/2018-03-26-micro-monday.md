<p style="text-align: left;">
  Micro Monday recommendation for this week is Chris Aldrich.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I would probably describe Chris as a geek&#8217;s geek (as in he would out-geek most regular geeks).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Just taking a look at his website and all the linking and interlinking it has ongoing with Web 2.0 and social media makes me want to tip my virtual hat to him.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Now I&#8217;m no stranger to syndicating content across the Internet, having used services like Ping.FM and Hootsuite extensively in the past.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But Chris&#8217; take on syndication is more minimalistic and hence all the more impressive, and in addition, counting Twitter and Mastodon as syndication copies is something I have very rarely come across.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That is however only one aspect of the website. Chris&#8217; process of using his website for taking notes, bookmarks, as an online repository for his thoughtsÂ and drafts, etc. takes things to an entirely different level.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The blog is a treasure trove of information on building/designing a WordPress based website on the tenets of IndieWeb, and certainly something I plan to dig deeper into to try and incorporate into my own IndieWeb/Micro.Blog themed personal blog.
