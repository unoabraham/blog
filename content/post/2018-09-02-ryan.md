Amazon’s Jack Ryan hit the small screen on the 31st of August, and it’s been a good though not an exceptional ride on the espionage train.

Hollywood has struggled in the creation of it’s own version of James Bond, and Jack Ryan has over many years and iterations been a constant endeavor though unsuccessful for the most part.

The struggle is mainly due to the fact that Jack is an analyst and not a superspy.

John Krasinski has however made the right call, for the most part his version of Jack Ryan is an analyst and very less so an action hero.

The result is a good mix of entertainment and drama, very seldom seen in a spy thriller. Not much to the story, it’s the treatment that’s good here, as well as performances from the likes of John Krasinski, Wendell Pierce, and Ali Suliman.

You’ll be making the right call with Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan for your weekend binge watch, and at only 8 episodes it’s short, sweet, and very to the point.
