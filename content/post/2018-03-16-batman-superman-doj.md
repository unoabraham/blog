  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2975590/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a>!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And the takeaway here is…
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Superman can be killed.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The DC Extended Universe is a lot less fun than the <span data-original-name="Marvel Cinematic Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Anyways, I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be watching a 3-year-old movie that was universally panned at the time of its release, but I&#8217;ve got reasons.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I started to watch Justice League and from the onset, it was very much apparent something/somebody was missing, and I needed to watch Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice to catch up on what&#8217;s happened so far.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I did see Wonder Woman, I believe it was on the wife&#8217;s birthday but did actually end up enjoying the movie and especially <span data-original-name="Gal Gadot">Gal Gadot</span>. However, nothing in it that was related to Justice League and very certainly no spoilers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The verdict, a tad bit too long at over 3 hours, and not enough of <span data-original-name="Gal Gadot">Gal Gadot.</span>
