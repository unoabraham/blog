Justice League ain&#8217;t no Avengers, but it&#8217;s not half bad

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Well for starters…
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As Aquaman describes <span data-original-name="Gal Gadot">Gal Gadot.</span>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Probably the single reason to watch Justice League.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Other than that, it is pretty much of a miss than a hit as far as origin stories go, though it has its moments.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And, DC Extended Universe really needs to find their feet and running if they are to have any hope of matching/catching up with Marvel Cinematic Universe.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  PS: One cannot really believe that Zack Snyder is coming up with such movies, whatever happened to the guy who gave us Watchmen, 300, and Dawn of the Dead.
