  In response to <a href="https://micro.blog/40Tech/485704" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://micro.blog/40Tech/485704</a> and <a href="https://www.40tech.com/2018/04/15/20728/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.40tech.com/2018/04/15/20728/</a> and also going deeper into the IndieWeb.
</p>

<a href="https://micro.blog/40Tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40Tech</a>, I loved both 24 and Lost. But then I also liked/immensely enjoyed both House of Cards and Mr. Robot. Orphan Black too, but I need to catch up season 3 onwards.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I would recommend checking out Narcos, Stranger Things, Breaking Bad, Suits, Sherlock, Prison Break, Homeland, Person of Interest, The Mentalist, The Punisher, Daredevil, Black Mirror, Fringe, Scandal, and Dexter. And of course Game of Thrones.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I did not like House, Shameless, and The Good Wife, but my wife binged on them.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And +1 to Longmire and Battlestar Galactica.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Among the new ones I thoroughly enjoyed Altered Carbon.
