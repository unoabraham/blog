  So how does that work on Twitter or social media? You don&#8217;t really have anything to say or share, but you are still expected to post something.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The wise and the esoteric should always be able to come up with something.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But what about the rest of the folks? How do you post something every day and still come up with something meaningful enough to post every day?
