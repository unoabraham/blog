  I just noticed that I crossed 100 posts on this blog, I have been blogging (more microblogging) every day since I started in the month of January 2018.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Everybody struggles with creating and posting content, especially blog content, but now it has all been made much easier with microblogging, in simpler words simply posting status updates and photographs as well as location shares for the most part. It is a form of blogging, only micro in nature, hence the term microblogging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I got into microblogging after discovering Micro.Blog, and no I have never been a heavy user of either Twitter or Facebook, though now I have started syndicating my blog posts over there.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Microblogging on your own domain is a simple solution that lets you own and control your own content but also lets you post content and remain active on social silos like Facebook and Twitter by syndicating your blog content.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I will do a longer write-up of microblogging, but for starters, one of the best results of microblogging is hosting your content on your own domain and owning it for life.

  Hereâ€™s to the next 100 posts on my blog/microblog.
