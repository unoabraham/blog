  Narcos season 2, I binge-watched this one late into the night and then completed the remaining episodes without a break the very next day.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Yes, it’s really that good, and in fact even better than season 1. Wagner Moura as Pablo Escobar is one of the best performances ever, he’s menacing, both destructive and self-destructive, helpless, and yet always in control. One of the most complex characters ever pulled off with aplomb by Wagner Moura. Performances by the other 2 leads, Boyd Holbrook and Pedro Pascal are also in line with the exceptional level of filmmaking that Narcos has been so far.

  Narcos is highly recommended, some of the best filmmaking on display, and truly deserving of all awards and accolades and then some more.
