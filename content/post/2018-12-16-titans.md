God knows I watch a lot of TV... so I've been reluctant to pick up on any new shows, unless of course something truly worthy came along.

Nothing on that front the last couple of years, but that's a story for another day.

Until I recently tuned into Titans and binge-watched all the episodes with only the yet to be aired season finale remaining.

Titans is good stuff and nearer to the darkness of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy than any other show in the recent past.

It is certainly worth catching up on especially if you haven't dug into the DC Universe yet.
