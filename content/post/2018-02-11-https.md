  The world is going to be more secure soon, at least the online world thanks to Google and the Chrome browser who have been pushing for widespread adoption of SSL/HTTPS over HTTP.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  In fact, starting sometime in July, all traffic going to HTTP will be labeled as unsafe by Chrome and possibly all of Google.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  That basically meant my entire day was spent moving all of my websites over to HTTPS. Easily done in the end, but only once you get the hang of it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s an easier task if you are using managed hosting, just need to set it up in Control Panel or your hostingÂ support will help you out.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Since I wanted to be self-taught in everything and I use my own VPS on the likes of <a href="https://m.do.co/c/e3723356b65f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DigitalOcean</a>, I had to actually learn how to set up, configure it, and deploy it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Like I said, easy enough once you get a handle on it and there are tons of tutorial videos on YouTube that will walk you through it.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And now, <a href="https://abraham.uno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnoAbraham</a> has a shiny new secure green padlock in the browser address bar.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yay!!!
