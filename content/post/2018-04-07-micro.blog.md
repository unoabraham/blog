  Ha ha, I cannot see myself on <a href="https://micro.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micro.Blog</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  And by that, I mean my latest posts, status updates, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Not on the Timeline, not on Discover.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am guessing that means it is good to see a lot more people on Micro.Blog, wishing it even more success.
