Watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3896198/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a>.

Double the fun you ask? Well not nearly, but certainly a blast the second time around too.

Chris Pratt AKA Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, and Bradley Cooper keep you entertained along with Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan.

New additions are Pom Klementieff, Sylvester Stallone, Kurt Russell, and cameos by Ving Rhames and Michelle Yeoh.

It&#8217;s a recommended watch, especially a doubleheader with the prequel.
