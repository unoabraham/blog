The Mighty Peking Man has a little bit of everything... King Kong, heartbreak and lost love, tiger, leopard, snake, snake and leopard fight, blonde lady Tarzan (yes in the jungles of India), a typhoon, lots of bad guys, one good guy, and everything culminating in a Honk Kong highrise King Kong type of ending.

As "bad" movies go, this is a decent watch, though not for the home collection unless you are probably a collector of bad and B movies.

I personally did not enjoy it very much, if that helps any.
