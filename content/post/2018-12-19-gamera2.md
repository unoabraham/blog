Gamera returns, and so does the fun.

Meteors crash on earth and along with them come the Legion, an alien life form, insect/bug like creatures that will destroy all life on earth.

Gamera to the rescue with some help from the army. Ayako Fujitani who has a special bond with Gamera returns, though only in a cameo.

Another good Kaiju flick.
