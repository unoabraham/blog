<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> is lots of fun. You can quote me on that.

I hadn&#8217;t seen this in the past, just never got around to it or made the time for it.

Now while doing it as part of the Avengers: Infinity War catch up I have to say it&#8217;s a blast. I really had a lot of fun with it,

Chris Pratt AKA Star-Lord is a blast. Zoe Saldana does a good job, but continues to be covered in green color this time around. Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel as I am Groot, and Bradley Cooper as Rocket add to the mayhem and the fun.

Ably supported by Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, John C. Reilly, Glenn Close, and Benicio Del Toro.

Guardians of the Galaxy is lots of fun and much recommended.
