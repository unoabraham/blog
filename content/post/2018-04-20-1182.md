  A Storyblog for you and your loved ones, IndieWeb style!
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  A really good video, and an important one at that by Brianna Privett over at <a href="https://wordpress.tv/2017/12/10/brianna-privett-the-story-of-your-life-using-wordpress-as-your-memory-warehouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brianna Privett: The Story of Your Life: Using WordPress as Your Memory Warehouse</a>.Â You can also watch the hosted video over at <a href="https://videopress.com/v/U0gPiHH6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoPress by clicking here</a>.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Highly recommend watching the video, lots of good takeaways about owning your content, keeping a storehouse of your memories for life and also delegating the responsibility for after, having a central repository of all your content and memories IndieWeb style, syndicating your content to social media and commercial silos, etc.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It also managed to sell me on continuing with WordPress, as well as recommending it, especially for the ease of use both for the non-geeks and folks starting over.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And it has also convinced me that I need to get my family posting on their own domains and owning their content.
