  Indie means independent, so IndieWeb means the independent web.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, the blurb on the IndieWeb website goes
</p>

> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the &#8220;corporate web&#8221;.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In other words, it&#8217;s not just an independent web, but it is the Internet that is free of corporate ownership, corporate silos, and more importantly, a web in which you the individual own your content.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I have been blogging from around 2004.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Initially, I started with XSitePro, and then used Drupal and even dabbled with Joomla! somewhere in the middle, before finally settling on WordPress (for life at least as it stands now). I have always self-hosted my blogs, and if ever (very rarely) used Web 2.0 for syndication, but never as a platform for blogging.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So in a way you can say I have always been an IndieWeb publisher.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Most folks don&#8217;t realize that they no longer own the content they have shared/uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, etc. If you carefully read the Terms of Service you will learn that the content is owned by the company a.k.a. the content silo and they have the legal rights to use it any way they see fit including for commercial advertising.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  People are slowly discovering this now, especially with all the data leaks that are making the news and letting us know how Facebook has been using our information to make billions with scant regard for our privacy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now that #DeleteFacebook is a thing, it is time people discovered an alternative to content silos like Facebook and Twitter, which brings us to the IndieWeb.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Simply put, I own the content for life and I choose where to host it and who to share it with. In other words, nobody can take your content and use it for their personal gain.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If you look at my recent posts on Facebook and Twitter, all you will see is a link back to my website. Other than the link, there is no actual content being posted/shared on Facebook or Twitter. In other words, Facebook and Twitter do not have my photographs, videos, or even my status updates to use in any way. Users can still interact and like/comment on my timeline, however, they still need to visit my website for the actual content itself. Likewise, I can choose to respond on Facebook or Twitter or even better still I can choose to respond on my own website and keep the interaction limited to my website.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When interacting with other website owners and over their content, I can choose to comment on their website or better still comment on my own website and send out a Webmention that notifies the blog owner/content creator of my response. So, I can always own and host my content and retain all control and ownership, even when I am commenting and interacting with other bloggers and content creators.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Now that should get everybody excited, imagine having your own Instagram on your own domain. I am setting up mine at <a href="https://abraham.gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham.Gallery</a>. Likewise, I have my own Facebook and Twitter set up on <a href="https://abraham.uno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abraham.Uno</a>. It is also possible to have your own private family network that only members of your family can access and share content on. Imagine that, a personalized/private family network that members of your family can use to share photographs, videos, recipes, status updates, send out invitations, etc. and nobody else can pry or have access to it.

  Well, I hope that has whet your appetite, and you look forward to catching up on the rest of the series. I have a lot more to share on this topic, and I will be adding more posts. You can visit the <a href="https://abraham.uno/indieweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWeb</a> page and bookmark it. I will post links to more content on that page, so you can find things more easily.
