This website WAS built on the tenets of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndieWeb</a> back when it was running on WordPress.

I have not yet updated/upgraded to the IndieWeb since moving to the static site generator Hugo. I have plans to do it, but also it will require reading up and more work as the Hugo framework is not extensible/expandable with the use of plug-ins like the WordPress framework.

I am however leaving the IndieWeb links and posts intact, as they will still point folks in the right direction of owning their online identity and content.

================================================

What is the IndieWeb you say? In their own words…

> The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web".

In my words "it is the independent web, and simply put it is your content that you own, control, and self host on your own domain".

This page will serve as an introduction to what is the IndieWeb, why you need it, and how you can get it.

I cannot honestly say that I have ever struggled with social media or privacy issues of any kind, but I have never been much active on social media or a heavy user either Facebook or Twitter.

I have however been a blogger for a very long time (since early 2000s), and even as a kid I kept a personal diary.

So why an online microblog? Well for starters, I got tired of writing with a pen and paper, and also not being able to share it with others. It was also hard to post status updates on Twitter and Facebook and then lose them (and their associated memories) just a couple of days later. We share so much of our lives and memories on social media, only to lose track of them and forget them just a day later.

Case in point, it took me a really long time to find them on Facebook. But they were memories and something I remembered as Avengers: Infinity War was around the corner and we were making plans to watch it.

I only use it as an example, but the truth is I cannot find any of the photographs or content I have shared on Facebook and Twitter, at least not when I need it. There is no searching your content, categorising it,or having the permanent links easily available. That’s simply the nature of the beast, and how social media works, in wanting us to share our latest, and then promptly forgetting it, and asking for more.

Simply put, you don’t own your data, and you have signed away the rights to the likes of Facebook and Twitter who don’t really value you or your data. To them we are nothing but advertising dollars.

Data loss is another issue, you lose everything - every post, every status update, every photograph, every link, etc. they all disappear if (and when) the social network dies. This has happened to me in the past and I can honestly say I’ve lost a chunk of my data over at various social networks like MySpace and Orkut when they went kaput.

So this is me microblogging, owning my data, and keeping my memories alive even when the social networks don’t exist in the future.

Have a read through them, and if it is something that resonates with you, then join us over at the IndieWeb.
