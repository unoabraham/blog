This started with the realization that I was a music lover and an audiophile who wasn’t listening to music (<a href="https://abraham.one/73/an-audiophile-who-doesnt-listen-to-music/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">An Audiophile Who Doesn&apos;t Listen to Music</a>). Instead I had turned over the music reins in my life to smart digital assistants and had begun to let them decide what and who I was going to listen to.

The result was predictably bad music, even by today’s standards. After a particularly bad session of American Top 40, my wife decided we had had enough and wanted to go back to “good” music.

Myself too after the litany of cacophony and an assault on my musical sensibilities, came to the realization that if the love for music was to continue in my life, I needed to change how and who I listened to.

So I set myself the goal of listening to one artist or band for an entire week, and going through their entire discography. This would be digging deep into their music and getting to know them better than a superficial listening session.

Now this is how I actually listen to music every day.

I (and the wife) start with a lengthy 2-hour session before we start with our daily chores. We again sit down for another lengthy session of 2 hours or more after dinner, and this can very often go late into the night. Most days though our morning session extends into a lengthy afternoon session and we can end up listening to music for several hours during the entire day, but obviously going about our daily chores. 

On occasion I have been known to put in over 10 hours and even near to 15 hours, especially when hanging out with the greats like Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin, but that’s a story for another day.

Starting with this plan, and at the time of writing this (June 2, 2018) we have now spent the last 10 weeks listening to an eclectic mix of bands and musicians, and our experience has left us clamoring for more. The musical week starts on Saturday and ends Friday (the next week).

After this experience, I would invite you, even urge you to set some musical goals for yourself and your family. There is something to be said about hanging out with musical greats and letting them sing to you daily.

Hop right in, and may the Force be with you on your musical journeys.
