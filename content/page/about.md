Hey, my name is Rajiv Abraham Nela. I am a Christian, audiophile, videophile, shutterbug, gamer, geek, foodie, and occasional blogger... and also a lot of other things!

This is my blog, where I post random notes, status updates, photographs, and the occasional lengthy blog post. Think of it as a blog, microblog, photoblog, and also my social media stream of Facebook and Twitter all rolled into one.
