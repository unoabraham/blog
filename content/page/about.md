Hey, my name is Rajiv Abraham. I am a Christian, audiophile, foodie, gamer, shutterbug, geek... and many other things!

This is my blog, where I post random notes, status updates, photographs, and the occasional lengthy blog post. Think of it as a blog, microblog, photoblog, and also my social media stream of Facebook and Twitter all rolled into one.
