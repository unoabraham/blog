Hey, my name is Rajiv Abraham. I am a Christian, audiophile, foodie, smartphone shutterbug, and geek... and many other things!

This is my microblog, where I post random notes, status updates, photographs, and the occasional lengthy blog post. Think of it as a blog, microblog, photoblog, and also my Facebook and Twitter all rolled into one.
