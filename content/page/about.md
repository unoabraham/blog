Hey, my name is Rajiv Abraham. I am a Christian, audiophile, foodie, smartphone shutterbug, and geek.

This is my microblog, where I post random my posts, status updates, still photographs, and the occasional lengthy blog post. Mostly though, this is my personal social network instead of Facebook and Twitter.

I cannot honestly say that I have ever struggled with social media or privacy issues of any kind, but I have never been much active on social media or a heavy user either Facebook or Twitter.

I have however been a blogger for a very long time, and even as a kid I wrote and kept a personal diary.

So why microblog? Well for starters, I got tired of posting status updates on Twitter and Facebook and then losing them (and their associated memories) just a couple of days later. We share so much of our lives and memories on social media, only to lose track of them and forget them a day later.

Case in point, it took me a really long time to find them on Facebook. But they were memories and something I remembered as Avengers: Infinity War was around the corner and we were making plans to watch it.

I only use them as examples, but the truth is I cannot find any of the photographs or content I have shared on Facebook and Twitter, at least not when I need it. That’s simply the nature of the beast, and how social media works, in wanting us to share our latest, and then promptly forgetting it, and asking for more.

Simply put, you don’t own your data, and you have signed away the rights to the likes of Facebook and Twitter who don’t really value you or your data. To them we are nothing but advertising dollars.

Data loss is another issue, you lose everything - every post, every status update, every photograph, every link, etc. they all disappear if (and when) the social network dies. This has happened to me in the past and I can honestly say I’ve lost a chunk of my data over at various social networks like MySpace and Orkut when they went kaput, and even on Facebook and Twitter that I cannot locate, or deleted an account/profile and started over. 

So this is me microblogging, owning my data, and keeping my memories alive even when the social networks don’t exist in the future.
