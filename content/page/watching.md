Watching is more like a watched list. The idea is to have a best of lists culled from the internet that I've watched with a line or two of my thoughts on it. I will be starting with the IMDb Top 250 movies list, and keep adding as I go along.

* IMDb Top 250 Movies (https://abraham.one/page/imdb-movie-top-250/).
* IMDB Top TV Series With Rating Count Of At Least 10,000 (https://abraham.one/page/imdb-tv-top-10000/).
